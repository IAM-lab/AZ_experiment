                        You are about to take part in an experiment conducted by the <strong>University of Manchester</strong> and the Advanced Analytics Centre at <strong>AstraZeneca</strong>.
                        <br /><br />
                        <h4>Why do this study?</h4>
                        We believe better biomarker visualization tools are needed to support scientists and decision makers. Effective knowledge acquisition depends on technologies
                        that support the translation of biomarker data into readily understandable information. This process involves the interaction of access to data, its
                        visualization, and its interpretation. Visualization of data influences: the speed of information interpretation and how that information is interpreted.
                        Please answer honestly and to the best of your knowledge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h4>What would we be asking you to do?</h4>
                        During this experiment you will be asked to view a series of visualisations (8 in total) based on biomarker data. For each visualization, we would like you to complete a short task.
                        After each task is completed (an answer like “I could not answer” is also valid for completion), we would like to gather your feedback about it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you wish to take part in the study you must first read the participant information sheet and provide consent. We will then ask you a few background questions,
                        which include some general questions about reading information from graphs and then the experiment will start.

                You are being invited to take part in a research study. Before you decide to take part it is important for you to understand why the

            <h5 class="pis-left">What is the purpose of the research?</h5>
            <p class="pis-text-para">
                We are interested in understanding how people use visualisations of biomarker data and other patient-level covariates to inform decisions in
                clinical trials. These can include clinical, financial, research and resource allocation decisions. This understanding can help to address issues
                in current usage of visualisations and potentially be used to feedback knowledge into the design of improved future visualisations and improving
                the presentation of existing visualisations.

            <h5 class="pis-left">Why have I been chosen?</h5>
            <p class="pis-text-para">
                You have been chosen as you represent a user of these types of data visualisations.

            <h5 class="pis-left">What would I be asked to do if I took part?</h5>
            <p class="pis-text-para">
                You will be asked to complete some initial questions about your demographics and professional background. Following this you will complete
                a short survey that assesses your understanding of reading data from graphs (graph literacy). You will then be represented with 4 visualisations
                twice randomly (you will see 8 visualisations in total). 4 of the visualisations will be accompanied by additional information about the visualisation and
                4 will not. A question will be posed with each visualisation that involve extracting some information from the visualisation in order to answer
                the question. Following each visualisation you will asked a few questions about the visualization. The study can be completed online. A subset of
                people will be asked to complete this study in person and will additionally have their gaze (eye-movements) recorded with an eye-tracker. This will
                only be used on people that are visited in person and not those that complete the survey online only.
