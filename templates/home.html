                        You are about to take part in an experiment conducted by the <strong>University of Manchester</strong> and <strong>AstraZeneca</strong>.
                        <br />
                        <h4>Why do this study?</h4>
                        We believe better biomarker visualization tools are needed to support scientists and decision makers. Effective knowledge acquisition depends on technologies
                        that support the translation of biomarker data into readily understandable information. This process involves the interaction of access to data, its
                        visualization, and its interpretation. Visualization of data influences: the speed of information interpretation and how that information is interpreted.
                        Please answer honestly and to the best of your knowledge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h4>What would we be asking you to do?</h4>
                        During this experiment you will be asked to view a series of visualisations (4 in total) based on biomarker data. For each visualization, we would like you to complete a short task.
                        After each task is completed (an answer like “I could not answer” is also valid for completion), we would like to gather your feedback about it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you wish to take part in the study you must first read the participant information sheet and provide consent. We will then ask you a few background questions,
                        which include some general questions about reading information from graphs and then the experiment will start.

            <h5 class="pis-left">What is the purpose of the research?</h5>
            <p class="pis-text-para">
                We are interested in understanding how people use visualisations of biomarker data and other patient-level covariates to inform decisions in
                clinical trials. These can include clinical, financial, research and resource allocation decisions. This understanding can help to address issues
                in current usage of visualisations and potentially be used to feedback knowledge into the design of improved future visualisations and improving
                the presentation of existing visualisations.
            </p>
            <h5 class="pis-left">Why have I been chosen?</h5>
            <p class="pis-text-para">
                You have been chosen as you represent a user of these types of data visualisations.
            </p>
            <h5 class="pis-left">What would I be asked to do if I took part?</h5>
            <p class="pis-text-para">
                You will be asked to complete some initial questions about your demographics and professional background. Following this you will complete
                a short standardized survey that assesses your understanding of reading data from graphs (called the graph literacy scale). You will then be
                asked to complete 4 short tasks that will involve you using information presented using a visualisation. There are 4 of these tasks in total.
                <br/><br/>
                Participants are randomly allocated into one of 3 groups at the start of the experiment. The group will determine if you are shown additional
                information with the visualisation or not. Following each task you will be asked a series of short questions relating to the task and what you
                thought about it.
                <br/><br/>
                The study can be completed online at a time and place of your own choosing. Progress is not saved so you will need to complete the study in
                a single sitting. We recommend that you allow up to 45 minutes for this. A subset of
                participants will be asked to complete this study in person and will additionally have their gaze (eye-movements) recorded with an eye-tracker. This will
                only be used with people that are visited in person and not those that complete the survey online only.

            <p class="pis-text-para">
                Yes - your participation in the study will be kept confidential to the study team. We do not record your name or other personally identifiable information
                using the survey. Participants will be allocated a code. For those taking part in the eye-tracking sub-group the code will be used to match their
                questionnaire data to their eye-tracking data. Names will not be associated with the data at any point.
                Once we have collected the data, we will not know which individual it belongs to.

            <h5 class="pis-left">How is confidentiality maintained?</h5>
            <p class="pis-text-para">

                If you decide to take part, you are still free to withdraw at any time without giving a reason and without detriment to yourself.
                However, it will not be possible to remove your data from the project once it has been anonymised and forms part of the dataset,
                as we will not be able to identify your specific data. This does not affect your data protection rights.
